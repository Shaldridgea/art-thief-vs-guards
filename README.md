# Art Thief vs. Guards

This project is an interactive simulation of competing AI techniques, presented as a thief trying to steal a piece of art in a gallery that's patrolled by a few guards.

The thief uses a utility/goal-based AI, while the guards use behaviour trees. These AI systems have been written from scratch for this project.

Assets taken from online are credited in the [credits file](Asset%20Credits.txt), anything not credited was made by me for this project.
